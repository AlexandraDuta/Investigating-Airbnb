# 'Attractive' Hosts: a global AirBnB research

## What is 'attractive' host?
Attractive host refers to the host that due to specific qualities, traits and other factors is more preferable than the other competitive AirBnb hosts.
## And why global?
Simply because the world is more connected than ever before!
Travelling has become a global trend and consequently travellers from Europe can now reach destinations in Asia and get to know the local culture, a couple from Latin America can safely book accommodation for their adventurous trip in the magical landscapes of Africa or a researcher from Australia can easily select a single room for his investigation journey to North America and the list is endless...

## Research Motivation
As a result of this global connectivity and increased travelling frequency the pioneering platform of AirBnB has been established as the leader in online lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals and tourism activities with more than 2.8 million hosts(2021). Nevertheless, increased offer comes with increased competition and the hosts need to find new ways of attracting the people.
The main purpose of this research is to provide usefull insight and tips to AirBnB's hosts in order to improve their overall performance and service delivery before the booking reservation. Additionally, we are going to compare 'cultural' tendencies for the most popular destinations of 2021 across different continents.
