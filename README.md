# Case Italy: Hosts Qualities' booking impact

## A comparison in the number of bookings across Italy
How does the host's response time and the hostâ€™s membership time affect the number of bookings across two different cities of Italy? Can it be a competitive advantage for hosts?
We are going to take a deep dive through multiple datasets directly from AirBnB and find out the answer!  

## Motivation
This investigation aims to compare the influence of the host's response time and the host's membership time on the number of bookings in AirBnBs located in two Italian cities, namely Venice and Bergamo. This cities have been particularily chosen because of the hard contrast in their popularity. More specifically, Venice has been recognized as the most popular city in Italy, while Bergamo has been recognized as a not yet a very popular destination. We believe that the variables under investigation (i.e.,host's response time and host's membership time on the website) have a strong impact on the number of bookings and we would like to futher analyze this.

## About
In the context of the course Data Preparation and Workflow Management, part of the MSc Marketing Analytics in Tilburg University, we will study the impact of host response time (i.e., how quickly a host responds to (potential) guests) and host membership time (i.e., for how long a host has been a member of the Airbnb site) on the number of bookings made in two different cities in Italy: a more touristy one, Venice, and a less touristy one, Bergamo. Our team is composed of five members: Alexandra Duta, Renos Chatzistavrou, Aikaterini Kalpaxi, Polina Petkova, and Maria Vencheva.
