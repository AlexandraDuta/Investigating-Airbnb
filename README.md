## About
In the context of the course Data Preparation and Workflow Management, we will study the impact of the host response time and the host membership time on the number of bookings made in two different cities in Italy: a more touristy, Venice, and a less touristy, Bergamo. Our team is composed of five members: Alexandra Duta, Renos Chatzistavrou, Aikaterini Kalpaxi, Polina Petkova, and Maria Vencheva.
