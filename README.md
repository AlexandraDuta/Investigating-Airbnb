## A comparison in the number of bookings across Italy
How does the host_response_time and the hostâ€™s membership time affect the number of bookings in each city (Venice vs. Bergamo)?

## Motivation


## About
In the context of the course Data Preparation and Workflow Management, part of the MSc Marketing Analytics in Tilburg University, we will study the impact of host response time (i.e., how quickly a host responds to (potential) guests) and host membership time (i.e., for how long a host has been a member of the Airbnb site) on the number of bookings made in two different cities in Italy: a more touristy one, Venice, and a less touristy one, Bergamo. Our team is composed of five members: Alexandra Duta, Renos Chatzistavrou, Aikaterini Kalpaxi, Polina Petkova, and Maria Vencheva.
