## A comparison in the number of bookings across Italy
How does the host_response_time and the hostâ€™s membership time affect the number of bookings in each city (Venice vs. Bergamo)?

## Motivation



## Method and results

First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.

Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

## Repository overview

Provide an overview of the directory structure and files.

## Running instructions

Explain to potential users how to run/replicate your workflow. Touch upon, if necessary, the required input data, which (secret) credentials are required (and how to obtain them), which software tools are needed to run the workflow (including links to the installation instructions), and how to run the workflow. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

## More resources

Point interested users to any related literature and/or documentation.

## About
In the context of the course Data Preparation and Workflow Management, part of the MSc Marketing Analytics in Tilburg University, we will study the impact of host response time (i.e., how quickly a host responds to (potential) guests) and host membership time (i.e., for how long a host has been a member of the Airbnb site) on the number of bookings made in two different cities in Italy: a more touristy one, Venice, and a less touristy one, Bergamo. Our team is composed of five members: Alexandra Duta, Renos Chatzistavrou, Aikaterini Kalpaxi, Polina Petkova, and Maria Vencheva.
